# Exotic Dice

## [D24: Pentagonal Icositetrahedron](d24.md)

- first version with natural face enumeration done
- novel 24-glyph "octernary" face labeling system devised
- an imperfect trade-off between 4-facet and 3-facet sum balance has been achieved
  TODO can it be further improved or edge adjacnecy also taken into account?
- TODO a desk base/stand with octernary translation / lookup mechanismm ( ring around the outside? )
- TODO try out a deltoidal icositetrahedron alternative instead

## TODO D60: Pentagonal Hexecontahedron

## Further TODO

- try out other notions from <https://www.mathpuzzle.com/Fairdice.htm>
