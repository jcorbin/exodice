# Construction

The scad model works by subtracting 6 facets from a solid cube.
Each facet is composed of 4 cubes with their south-z facial planes intersecting
at a point (one of the degree-4 vertices of the final polyhedra).

The angular relations between the 4 cubes in each facet [surprisingly
involve][wolfram_pentico] the [tribonacci constant][wiki_trib].

# Topology

## 4-facets

Each face has 5 adjacents; the longer point of each face meets at a vertex with 4 other faces.
By construction, these are monotonically enumerated and group naturally:

     1  2  3  4
     5  6  7  8
     9 10 11 12
    13 14 15 16
    17 18 19 20
    21 22 23 24

## 3-facets

The other 4 vertexes of each face meet 3 other faces.
These facet groups have less obvious patterns,
and join between the natrual 4-facets listed above.

Each face is part of 4 3-facets, but below we list:
- in clockwise order around each 3-facet
- starting from the lowest member face
- eliding duplicates

    1 2 15
    1 15 16
    1 16 22
    1 22 4
    2 3 20
    2 20 17
    2 17 15
    3 4 5
    3 5 6
    3 6 20
    4 22 23
    4 23 5
    5 23 8
    6 7 19
    6 19 20
    7 8 9
    7 9 10
    7 10 19
    8 23 24
    8 24 9
    9 24 12
    10 11 18
    10 18 19
    11 12 13
    11 13 14
    11 14 18
    12 24 21
    12 21 13
    13 21 16
    14 15 17
    14 17 18
    16 21 22

## Adjacencies

So then from the facet lists above we can generate all adjacencies.

For example the first 4-facet `1 2 3 4` generates:

    1 2
    2 3
    3 4
    4 1

And the first 3-facet `1 2 15` generates:

    1 2
    2 15
    15 1

NOTE: one might canonicalize the final "loopback" adjacents above as `1 4` and `1 15`
# Face to Label Mapping

Here are the goals considered when placing labels on faces beyond a direct
mapping of face index to label:

1. minimize variation of facets sums (faces that meet at a 4-vertex)
2. minimize variation of faces that meet at a 3-vertex
3. minimize variation of edge-adjacent face values
4. somehow balance or relate opposing facet pairs (sets of 4 faces which are opposite each other)

Currently the model and its companion jupyter notebook imperfectly balances goals 1 and 2.
Further layout permutation may be explored going forward.

It's unclear whether goal 2 or goal 3 are better, or whether there are any
feasibility concerns between them or with goal 1. It's further unclear how
feasible goal 4 is, or what it might even mean at this point.

Goals 1 and 2 and the sense of fairness/magicness are inspired by [magic-numbered d20 and d30][magic_d230],
while goal 4 is an analog of the classic d6 opposite-face-sum-7 rule,
and goal 3 that of unclear attribution.
